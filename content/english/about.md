# About me

I am a PhD student doing research at the Department of Information and Communication Engineering ([DEiC](https://deic.uab.cat/)) at the Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona ([UAB](https://www.uab.cat/)).


My current interests are Bitcoin, the Lightning Network and protocols on top of Bitcoin. In fact, these are the topics on which I do research ðŸ˜‰. Apart from Bitcoin related topics, I am also passionate about cryptography, privacy, cybersecurity and programming.

If you need to contact me, you can find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/sliv3r__) or on IRC on the [Libera](https://web.libera.chat/) network under the username sliv3r__.
