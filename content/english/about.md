# About me

I am doing research at the Department of Information and Communication Engineering ([DEiC](https://deic.uab.cat/)) at the Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona ([UAB](https://www.uab.cat/)).

My current interests are Bitcoin, the Lightning Network and protocols on top of Bitcoin. In fact, these are the topics on which I do research ðŸ˜‰. Apart from Bitcoin related topics, I am also passionate about cryptography, privacy, cybersecurity and programming.
